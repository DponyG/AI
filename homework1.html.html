    <h1>Nim's Game</h1>
    <h4>Rules</h4>
    <p>Given a starting number two players each take turns splitting it into different piles. You may only  split once per turn.
        You made not split a stack into equal groups. For example if the pile was 4 -  3 - 1. You could not split the 4 to
        a 2 - 2. The player who can not split has lost the game. Min  goes first.</p>
    <h4>How to use </h4>
    <p>When you run the program a poorly made GUI will appear with the current number of games. I have
       also started the pile with 5. Simply click the Start button. A list of possible moves will appear on the right. You will choose
       and then the computer will choose. Once you have completed the game Click the start button to increment pile.  </p>
    <h4>Implementation: </h4>
    <p>I implemented a Minimax AI with 1 being a win for the MAX player, and 0 being a win for the MIN  player. A tree that
        starts at 7 would look something like this. Each player will only take a node  that leads them to a win. If no nodes
        lead them to a win then they pick a random node. If more  nodes lead them to a node they pick the first one. </p>

    <h4>Optimization</h4>
    <p>Optimization  The ability to create the tree and populate the correct minimax for each node becomes  extremely slow at
        a counter of about 12-15. I believe the reason for this is because 6-1 and 5-2  can split into 4 - 2 -1, however,
        the way I have created my tree each one would contain a 4 - 2 -1  child node. So an optimization I could do in the
        future would have each parent point to the same  child node, as long as they were on the same depth. I believe this
        would speed up the time it  takes to generate a tree, and perform a minimax</p>
